# Current Task
Phase 1.1 complete. Ready to begin Phase 1.2: The Simulator.

## Completed (Phase 1.1)
- [x] Category filtering (SOFT DRINKS, 117K transactions)
- [x] Elasticity parameter estimation (α=0.8, β=0.045)
- [x] Training sequences and features generated
- [x] All 11 tests passing

## Next Up (Phase 1.2)
1. Implement `src/discount_engine/simulators/customer.py` using estimated α/β.
2. Validate simulated user "addicts" correctly (purchase probability drops after repeated discounts removed).
3. Add tests for customer simulation logic.
